Feature Descriptions for the Prime Spiral Dataset
The generated dataset contains structured information for each number 𝑛
n from 2 to 10,000, aiming to train a classifier capable of predicting whether 
a number is prime based on geometric properties derived from a polar spiral. 
Below is a description of each feature:

🔹 x and y – Cartesian Coordinates
Description: Position of the number on the spiral, converted to Cartesian plane.
Importance: Enables spatial visualization and helps detect clusters 
or visual patterns among prime numbers.

🔸 r – Radius
Description: Radial distance from the origin to the point on the spiral.
Importance: In a polar spiral, larger primes are located further from the center,
 which relates to the natural rarefaction of prime numbers.

🔸 theta – Polar Angle
Description: Angular position of the number in the spiral.
Importance: Helps identify symmetries and alignments of primes across spiral turns.

🔹 prime_density – Local Prime Density
Description: Number of prime numbers located within a fixed radius (e.g., 10 units) 
around the point 
Importance: Captures the "neighborhood" density — whether the number lies in a 
prime-rich or prime-sparse region.

🔹 avg_prime_distance – Average Distance to Nearby Primes
Description: Average Euclidean distance from the number to nearby primes within 
a certain radius.

Importance: Measures how tightly packed nearby primes are. Smaller average 
distances indicate a denser prime neighborhood.

🎯 is_prime – Target Label
Description: Binary class label indicating whether the number is prime (1) or 
not (0).

Importance: This is the target to be predicted by the classifier, using the 
other variables as features.
